AirBnB
The acronym AirBnB means: "Air Bed and Breakfast,” is a service that lets property owners rent out their spaces to travelers looking for a place to stay.
The goal of this project AriBnB clone, is to deploy on a server, a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

Project Description
(1)	This project is aim at developing an entire web application that simulates the behavior of the Airbnb platform. 
To proceed, we start with the Console/Interpreter. Then,
(2)	We proceed to the front-end(website) which shows the static and dynamic product of the project to the user. And next,
(3) 	We create a connection between the modules being created and database or files that stores the data being used. Finally,
(4)	We  create an API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them). 

Console/Interpreter
This console or command interpreter provides us with a framework that enables us manipulate data without a visual interface, such as the Shell wich is perfect for development and debbuging

This command interpreter allows us to:
create the data model.
manage (create, update and destroy) objects via a console.
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file).

by running codes that:

=> Starts  the program `$ ./console.py`
=> Use the program `(hbnb) code`
	 example : `
		(hbnb) echo "hello world"
		(hbnb) hello world

Front-end + Module & Data Storage + Api
All these are achieved simultaneouly as file creations progresses.



Files and Directiries needed.

/models directory constains all classes used for the project.
basemodel.py file contains the base class (BaseModel) of all models in the project:

user.py - file contains the User class.
state.py - file contains the State class.
city.py - file contains the Cityclass.
amenity.py - file contains the Amenity class.
place.py - file contains the Place class.
review.py - file contains the Review class.
/models/engine directory contains the class that handles JASON serialization and deserialization.
file_storage.py - file contains FileStorage class.

/tests directory contains all unit test cases for this project.

console.py the console contains the entry point of the command interpreter.
